+ *
+ * structure H5AC_aux_t
+ *
+ * While H5AC has become a wrapper for the cache implemented in H5C.c, there
+ * are some features of the metadata cache that are specific to it, and which
+ * therefore do not belong in the more generic H5C cache code.
+ *
+ * In particular, there is the matter of synchronizing writes from the
+ * metadata cache to disk in the PHDF5 case.
+ *
+ * Prior to this update, the presumption was that all metadata caches would
+ * write the same data at the same time since all operations modifying
+ * metadata must be performed collectively.  Given this assumption, it was
+ * safe to allow only the writes from process 0 to actually make it to disk,
+ * while metadata writes from all other processes were discarded.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, this presumption is in error as operations that read
+ * metadata need not be collective, but can change the location of dirty
+ * entries in the metadata cache LRU lists.  This can result in the same
+ * metadata write operation triggering writes from the metadata caches on
+ * some processes, but not all (causing a hang), or in different sets of
+ * entries being written from different caches (potentially resulting in
+ * metadata corruption in the file).
+ *
+ * To deal with this issue, I decided to apply a paradigm shift to the way
+ * metadata is written to disk.
+ *
+ * With this set of changes, only the metadata cache on process 0 is able
+ * to write metadata to disk, although metadata caches on all other
+ * processes can read metadata from disk as before.
+ *
+ * To keep all the other caches from getting plugged up with dirty metadata,
+ * process 0 periodically broadcasts a list of entries that it has flushed
+ * since that last notice, and which are currently clean.  The other caches
+ * mark these entries as clean as well, which allows them to evict the
+ * entries as needed.
+ *
+ * One obvious problem in this approach is synchronizing the broadcasts
+ * and receptions, as different caches may see different amounts of
+ * activity.
+ *
+ * The current solution is for the caches to track the number of bytes
+ * of newly generated dirty metadata, and to broadcast and receive
+ * whenever this value exceeds some user specified threshold.
+ *
+ * Maintaining this count is easy for all processes not on process 0 --
+ * all that is necessary is to add the size of the entry to the total
+ * whenever there is an insertion, a move of a previously clean entry,
+ * or whever a previously clean entry is marked dirty in an unprotect.
+ *
+ * On process 0, we have to be careful not to count dirty bytes twice.
+ * If an entry is marked dirty, flushed, and marked dirty again, all
+ * within a single reporting period, it only th first marking should
+ * be added to the dirty bytes generated tally, as that is all that
+ * the other processes will see.
+ *
+ * At present, this structure exists to maintain the fields needed to
+ * implement the above scheme, and thus is only used in the parallel
+ * case.  However, other uses may arise in the future.
+ *
+ * Instance of this structure are associated with metadata caches via
+ * the aux_ptr field of H5C_t (see H5Cpkg.h).  The H5AC code is
+ * responsible for allocating, maintaining, and discarding instances
+ * of H5AC_aux_t.
+ *
+ * The remainder of this header comments documents the individual fields
+ * of the structure.
+ *
+ *                                              JRM - 6/27/05
+ *
+ * Update: When the above was written, I planned to allow the process
+ *	0 metadata cache to write dirty metadata between sync points.
+ *	However, testing indicated that this allowed occasional 
+ *	messages from the future to reach the caches on other processes.
+ *
+ *	To resolve this, the code was altered to require that all metadata
+ *	writes take place during sync points -- which solved the problem.
+ *	Initially all writes were performed by the process 0 cache.  This 
+ *	approach was later replaced with a distributed write approach
+ *	in which each process writes a subset of the metadata to be 
+ *	written.  
+ *
+ *	After thinking on the matter for a while, I arrived at the 
+ *	conclusion that the process 0 cache could be allowed to write 
+ *	dirty metadata between sync points if it restricted itself to 
+ *	entries that had been dirty at the time of the previous sync point.  
+ *	
+ *	To date, there has been no attempt to implement this optimization.
+ *	However, should it be attempted, much of the supporting code 
+ *	should still be around.
+ *

+ *
+ * magic:       Unsigned 32 bit integer always set to
+ *		H5AC__H5AC_AUX_T_MAGIC.  This field is used to validate
+ *		pointers to instances of H5AC_aux_t.
+ *
+ * mpi_comm:	MPI communicator associated with the file for which the
+ *		cache has been created.
+ *
+ * mpi_rank:	MPI rank of this process within mpi_comm.
+ *
+ * mpi_size:	Number of processes in mpi_comm.
+ *
+ * write_permitted:  Boolean flag used to control whether the cache
+ *		is permitted to write to file.
+ *
+ * dirty_bytes_threshold: Integer field containing the dirty bytes
+ *		generation threashold.  Whenever dirty byte creation
+ *		exceeds this value, the metadata cache on process 0
+ *		broadcasts a list of the entries it has flushed since
+ *		the last broadcast (or since the beginning of execution)
+ *		and which are currently clean (if they are still in the
+ *		cache)
+ *
+ *		Similarly, metadata caches on processes other than process
+ *		0 will attempt to receive a list of clean entries whenever
+ *		the threshold is exceeded.
+ *
+ * dirty_bytes:  Integer field containing the number of bytes of dirty
+ *		metadata generated since the beginning of the computation,
+ *		or (more typically) since the last clean entries list
+ *		broadcast.  This field is reset to zero after each such
+ *		broadcast.
+ *
+ * metadata_write_strategy: Integer code indicating how we will be 
+ *		writing the metadata.  In the first incarnation of 
+ *		this code, all writes were done from process 0.  This
+ *		field exists to facilitate experiments with other 
+ *		strategies.

+ * unprotect_dirty_bytes_updates: This field only exists when the
+ *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
+ *

+ *              H5AC_DEBUG_DIRTY_BYTES_CREATION #define is TRUE.
