[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Disassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.\n    - H5VL_set_vol_wrapper src/H5VLint.c:2239:33\n    - H5VL_file_get src/H5VLcallback.c:3766:9\n    - H5Fget_access_plist src/H5F.c:175:9\n    - test_appropriate_ids poc.c:44:17\n    - main poc.c:80:5\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
