[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\n    - H5S__get_select_hyper_blocklist src/H5Shyper.c:4746:40\n    - H5Sget_select_hyper_blocklist src/H5Shyper.c:4868:21\n    - test_h5s_bug5 poc.c:17:15\n    - main poc.c:24:5\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
