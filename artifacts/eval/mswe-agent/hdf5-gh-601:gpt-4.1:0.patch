+/****************************************************************************
+ *
+ * structure H5AC_cache_config_t
+ *
+ * H5AC_cache_config_t is a public structure intended for use in public APIs.
+ * At least in its initial incarnation, it is basically a copy of struct
+ * H5C_auto_size_ctl_t, minus the report_fcn field, and plus the
+ * dirty_bytes_threshold field.
+ *
+ * The report_fcn field is omitted, as including it would require us to
+ * make H5C_t structure public.
+ *
+ * The dirty_bytes_threshold field does not appear in H5C_auto_size_ctl_t,
+ * as synchronization between caches on different processes is handled at
+ * the H5AC level, not at the level of H5C.  Note however that there is
+ * considerable interaction between this value and the other fields in this
+ * structure.
+ *
+ * Similarly, the open_trace_file, close_trace_file, and trace_file_name
+ * fields do not appear in H5C_auto_size_ctl_t, as most trace file
+ * issues are handled at the H5AC level.  The one exception is storage of
+ * the pointer to the trace file, which is handled by H5C.
+ *
+ * The structure is in H5ACpublic.h as we may wish to allow different
+ * configuration options for metadata and raw data caches.
+ *
+ * The fields of the structure are discussed individually below:
+ *
+ * version: Integer field containing the version number of this version
+ *      of the H5AC_cache_config_t structure.  Any instance of
+ *      H5AC_cache_config_t passed to the cache must have a known
+ *      version number, or an error will be flagged.
+ *
+ * rpt_fcn_enabled: Boolean field used to enable and disable the default
+ *    reporting function.  This function is invoked every time the
+ *    automatic cache resize code is run, and reports on its activities.
+ *
+ *    This is a debugging function, and should normally be turned off.
+ *
+ * open_trace_file: Boolean field indicating whether the trace_file_name
+ *     field should be used to open a trace file for the cache.
+ *
+ *      *** DEPRECATED *** Use H5Fstart/stop logging functions instead
+ *
+ *     The trace file is a debuging feature that allow the capture of
+ *     top level metadata cache requests for purposes of debugging and/or
+ *     optimization.  This field should normally be set to FALSE, as
+ *     trace file collection imposes considerable overhead.
+ *
+ *     This field should only be set to TRUE when the trace_file_name
+ *     contains the full path of the desired trace file, and either
+ *     there is no open trace file on the cache, or the close_trace_file
+ *     field is also TRUE.
+ *
+ * close_trace_file: Boolean field indicating whether the current trace
+ *     file (if any) should be closed.
+ *
+ *      *** DEPRECATED *** Use H5Fstart/stop logging functions instead
+ *
+ *     See the above comments on the open_trace_file field.  This field
+ *     should be set to FALSE unless there is an open trace file on the
+ *     cache that you wish to close.
+ *
+ * trace_file_name: Full path of the trace file to be opened if the
+ *     open_trace_file field is TRUE.
+ *
+ *      *** DEPRECATED *** Use H5Fstart/stop logging functions instead
+ *
+ *     In the parallel case, an ascii representation of the mpi rank of
+ *     the process will be appended to the file name to yield a unique
+ *     trace file name for each process.
+ *
+ *     The length of the path must not exceed H5AC__MAX_TRACE_FILE_NAME_LEN
+ *     characters.
+ *
+ * evictions_enabled:  Boolean field used to either report the current
+ *     evictions enabled status of the cache, or to set the cache's
+ *    evictions enabled status.
+ *
+ *     In general, the metadata cache should always be allowed to
+ *     evict entries.  However, in some cases it is advantageous to
+ *     disable evictions briefly, and thereby postpone metadata
+ *     writes.  However, this must be done with care, as the cache
+ *     can grow quickly.  If you do this, re-enable evictions as
+ *     soon as possible and monitor cache size.
+ *
+ *     At present, evictions can only be disabled if automatic
+ *     cache resizing is also disabled (that is, ( incr_mode ==
+ *    H5C_incr__off ) && ( decr_mode == H5C_decr__off )).  There
+ *    is no logical reason why this should be so, but it simplifies
+ *    implementation and testing, and I can't think of any reason
+ *    why it would be desireable.  If you can think of one, I'll
+ *    revisit the issue.
+ *
+ * set_initial_size: Boolean flag indicating whether the size of the
+ *      initial size of the cache is to be set to the value given in
+ *      the initial_size field.  If set_initial_size is FALSE, the
+ *      initial_size field is ignored.
+ *
+ * initial_size: If enabled, this field contain the size the cache is
+ *      to be set to upon receipt of this structure.  Needless to say,
+ *      initial_size must lie in the closed interval [min_size, max_size].
+ *
+ * min_clean_fraction: double in the range 0 to 1 indicating the fraction
+ *      of the cache that is to be kept clean.  This field is only used
+ *      in parallel mode.  Typical values are 0.1 to 0.5.
+ *
+ * max_size: Maximum size to which the cache can be adjusted.  The
+ *      supplied value must fall in the closed interval
+ *      [MIN_MAX_CACHE_SIZE, MAX_MAX_CACHE_SIZE].  Also, max_size must
+ *      be greater than or equal to min_size.
+ *
+ * min_size: Minimum size to which the cache can be adjusted.  The
+ *      supplied value must fall in the closed interval
+ *      [H5C__MIN_MAX_CACHE_SIZE, H5C__MAX_MAX_CACHE_SIZE].  Also, min_size
+ *      must be less than or equal to max_size.
+ *
+ * epoch_length: Number of accesses on the cache over which to collect
+ *      hit rate stats before running the automatic cache resize code,
+ *      if it is enabled.
+ *
+ *      At the end of an epoch, we discard prior hit rate data and start
+ *      collecting afresh.  The epoch_length must lie in the closed
+ *      interval [H5C__MIN_AR_EPOCH_LENGTH, H5C__MAX_AR_EPOCH_LENGTH].
+ *
+ *
+ * Cache size increase control fields:
+ *
+ * incr_mode: Instance of the H5C_cache_incr_mode enumerated type whose
+ *      value indicates how we determine whether the cache size should be
+ *      increased.  At present there are two possible values:
+ *
+ *      H5C_incr__off:  Don't attempt to increase the size of the cache
+ *              automatically.
+ *
+ *              When this increment mode is selected, the remaining fields
+ *              in the cache size increase section ar ignored.
+ *
+ *      H5C_incr__threshold: Attempt to increase the size of the cache
+ *              whenever the average hit rate over the last epoch drops
+ *              below the value supplied in the lower_hr_threshold
+ *              field.
+ *
+ *              Note that this attempt will fail if the cache is already
+ *              at its maximum size, or if the cache is not already using
+ *              all available space.
+ *
+ *      Note that you must set decr_mode to H5C_incr__off if you
+ *      disable metadata cache entry evictions.
+ *
+ * lower_hr_threshold: Lower hit rate threshold.  If the increment mode
+ *      (incr_mode) is H5C_incr__threshold and the hit rate drops below the
+ *      value supplied in this field in an epoch, increment the cache size by
+ *      size_increment.  Note that cache size may not be incremented above
+ *      max_size, and that the increment may be further restricted by the
+ *      max_increment field if it is enabled.
+ *
+ *      When enabled, this field must contain a value in the range [0.0, 1.0].
+ *      Depending on the incr_mode selected, it may also have to be less than
+ *      upper_hr_threshold.
+ *
+ * increment:  Double containing the multiplier used to derive the new
+ *      cache size from the old if a cache size increment is triggered.
+ *      The increment must be greater than 1.0, and should not exceed 2.0.
+ *
+ *      The new cache size is obtained my multiplying the current max cache
+ *      size by the increment, and then clamping to max_size and to stay
+ *      within the max_increment as necessary.
+ *
+ * apply_max_increment:  Boolean flag indicating whether the max_increment
+ *      field should be used to limit the maximum cache size increment.
+ *
+ * max_increment: If enabled by the apply_max_increment field described
+ *      above, this field contains the maximum number of bytes by which the
+ *      cache size can be increased in a single re-size.
+ *
+ * flash_incr_mode:  Instance of the H5C_cache_flash_incr_mode enumerated
+ *      type whose value indicates whether and by which algorithm we should
+ *      make flash increases in the size of the cache to accommodate insertion
+ *      of large entries and large increases in the size of a single entry.
+ *
+ *      The addition of the flash increment mode was occasioned by performance
+ *      problems that appear when a local heap is increased to a size in excess
+ *      of the current cache size.  While the existing re-size code dealt with
+ *      this eventually, performance was very bad for the remainder of the
+ *      epoch.
+ *
+ *      At present, there are two possible values for the flash_incr_mode:
+ *
+ *      H5C_flash_incr__off:  Don't perform flash increases in the size of
+ *              the cache.
+ *
+ *      H5C_flash_incr__add_space:  Let x be either the size of a newly
+ *              newly inserted entry, or the number of bytes by which the
+ *              size of an existing entry has been increased.
+ *
+ *              If
+ *                      x > flash_threshold * current max cache size,
+ *
+ *              increase the current maximum cache size by x * flash_multiple
+ *              less any free space in the cache, and star a new epoch.  For
+ *              now at least, pay no attention to the maximum increment.
+ *
+ *      In both of the above cases, the flash increment pays no attention to
+ *      the maximum increment (at least in this first incarnation), but DOES
+ *      stay within max_size.
+ *
+ *      With a little thought, it should be obvious that the above flash
+ *      cache size increase algorithm is not sufficient for all circumstances
+ *      -- for example, suppose the user round robins through
+ *      (1/flash_threshold) +1 groups, adding one data set to each on each
+ *      pass.  Then all will increase in size at about the same time, requiring
+ *      the max cache size to at least double to maintain acceptable
+ *      performance, however the above flash increment algorithm will not be
+ *      triggered.
+ *
+ *      Hopefully, the add space algorithms detailed above will be sufficient
+ *      for the performance problems encountered to date.  However, we should
+ *      expect to revisit the issue.
+ *
+ * flash_multiple: Double containing the multiple described above in the
+ *      H5C_flash_incr__add_space section of the discussion of the
+ *      flash_incr_mode section.  This field is ignored unless flash_incr_mode
+ *      is H5C_flash_incr__add_space.
+ *
+ * flash_threshold: Double containing the factor by which current max cache
+ *      size is multiplied to obtain the size threshold for the add_space flash
+ *      increment algorithm.  The field is ignored unless flash_incr_mode is
+ *      H5C_flash_incr__add_space.
+ *
+ *
+ * Cache size decrease control fields:
+ *
+ * decr_mode: Instance of the H5C_cache_decr_mode enumerated type whose
+ *      value indicates how we determine whether the cache size should be
+ *      decreased.  At present there are four possibilities.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__off:  Don't attempt to decrease the size of the cache
+ *              automatically.
+ *
+ *              When this increment mode is selected, the remaining fields
+ *              in the cache size decrease section are ignored.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__threshold: Attempt to decrease the size of the cache
+ *              whenever the average hit rate over the last epoch rises
+ *              above the value supplied in the upper_hr_threshold
+ *              field.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__age_out:  At the end of each epoch, search the cache for
+ *              entries that have not been accessed for at least the number
+ *              of epochs specified in the epochs_before_eviction field, and
+ *              evict these entries.  Conceptually, the maximum cache size
+ *              is then decreased to match the new actual cache size.  However,
+ *              this reduction may be modified by the min_size, the
+ *              max_decrement, and/or the empty_reserve.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold:  Same as age_out, but we only
+ *              attempt to reduce the cache size when the hit rate observed
+ *              over the last epoch exceeds the value provided in the
+ *              upper_hr_threshold field.
+ *
+ *      Note that you must set decr_mode to H5C_decr__off if you
+ *      disable metadata cache entry evictions.
+ *
+ * upper_hr_threshold: Upper hit rate threshold.  The use of this field
+ *      varies according to the current decr_mode:
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__off or H5C_decr__age_out:  The value of this field is
+ *              ignored.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__threshold:  If the hit rate exceeds this threshold in any
+ *              epoch, attempt to decrement the cache size by size_decrement.
+ *
+ *              Note that cache size may not be decremented below min_size.
+ *
+ *              Note also that if the upper_threshold is 1.0, the cache size
+ *              will never be reduced.
+ *
+ *      H5C_decr__age_out_with_threshold:  If the hit rate exceeds this
+ *              threshold in any epoch, attempt to reduce the cache size
+ *              by evicting entries that have not been accessed for more
+ *              than the specified number of epochs.
+ *
+ * decrement: This field is only used when the decr_mode is
