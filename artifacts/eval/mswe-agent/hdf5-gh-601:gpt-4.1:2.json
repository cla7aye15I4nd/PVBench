[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Disassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.\n    - H5MM_xfree src/H5MM.c:557:9\n    - H5P__facc_mdc_log_location_set src/H5Pfapl.c:3717:9\n    - H5P__set_pclass_cb src/H5Pint.c:3047:13\n    - H5P__do_prop src/H5Pint.c:2746:25\n    - H5P_set src/H5Pint.c:3126:9\n    - H5Pset_mdc_log_options src/H5Pfapl.c:4279:13\n    - main poc.c:27:5\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
