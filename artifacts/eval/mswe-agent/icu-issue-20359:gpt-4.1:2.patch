+/**
+ * AlphabeticIndex supports the creation of a UI index appropriate for a given language.
+ * It can support either direct use, or use with a client that doesn't support localized collation.
+ * The following is an example of what an index might look like in a UI:
+ * 
+ * <pre>
+ *  <b>... A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  ...</b>
+ *
+ *  <b>A</b>
+ *     Addison
+ *     Albertson
+ *     Azensky
+ *  <b>B</b>
+ *     Baker
+ *  ...
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * The class can generate a list of labels for use as a UI "index", that is, a list of
+ * clickable characters (or character sequences) that allow the user to see a segment
+ * (bucket) of a larger "target" list. That is, each label corresponds to a bucket in
+ * the target list, where everything in the bucket is greater than or equal to the character
+ * (according to the locale's collation). Strings can be added to the index;
+ * they will be in sorted order in the right bucket.
+ * <p>
+ * The class also supports having buckets for strings before the first (underflow),
+ * after the last (overflow), and between scripts (inflow). For example, if the index
+ * is constructed with labels for Russian and English, Greek characters would fall
+ * into an inflow bucket between the other two scripts.
+ * <p>
+ * The AlphabeticIndex class is not intended for public subclassing.
+ *
+ * <p><em>Note:</em> If you expect to have a lot of ASCII or Latin characters
+ * as well as characters from the user's language,
+ * then it is a good idea to call addLabels(Locale::getEnglish(), status).</p>
+ *
+ * <h2>Direct Use</h2>
+ * <p>The following shows an example of building an index directly.
+ *  The "show..." methods below are just to illustrate usage.
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * // Create a simple index.  "Item" is assumed to be an application
+ * // defined type that the application's UI and other processing knows about,
+ * //  and that has a name.
+ *
+ * UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
+ * AlphabeticIndex index = new AlphabeticIndex(desiredLocale, status);
+ * index->addLabels(additionalLocale, status);
+ * for (Item *item in some source of Items ) {
+ *     index->addRecord(item->name(), item, status);
+ * }
+ * ...
+ * // Show index at top. We could skip or gray out empty buckets
+ *
+ * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
+ *     if (showAll || index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
+ *         showLabelAtTop(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
+ *     }
+ * }
+ *  ...
+ * // Show the buckets with their contents, skipping empty buckets
+ *
+ * index->resetBucketIterator(status);
+ * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
+ *    if (index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
+ *        showLabelInList(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
+ *        while (index->nextRecord(status)) {
+ *            showIndexedItem(UI, static_cast<Item *>(index->getRecordData()))
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * The caller can build different UIs using this class.
+ * For example, an index character could be omitted or grayed-out
+ * if its bucket is empty. Small buckets could also be combined based on size, such as:
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * <b>... A-F G-N O-Z ...</b>
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * <h2>Client Support</h2>
+ * <p>Callers can also use the AlphabeticIndex::ImmutableIndex, or the AlphabeticIndex itself,
+ * to support sorting on a client that doesn't support AlphabeticIndex functionality.
+ *
+ * <p>The ImmutableIndex is both immutable and thread-safe.
+ * The corresponding AlphabeticIndex methods are not thread-safe because
+ * they "lazily" build the index buckets.
+ * <ul>
+ * <li>ImmutableIndex.getBucket(index) provides random access to all
+ *     buckets and their labels and label types.
+ * <li>The AlphabeticIndex bucket iterator or ImmutableIndex.getBucket(0..getBucketCount-1)
+ *     can be used to get a list of the labels,
+ *     such as "...", "A", "B",..., and send that list to the client.
+ * <li>When the client has a new name, it sends that name to the server.
+ * The server needs to call the following methods,
+ * and communicate the bucketIndex and collationKey back to the client.
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * int32_t bucketIndex = index.getBucketIndex(name, status);
+ * const UnicodeString &label = immutableIndex.getBucket(bucketIndex)->getLabel();  // optional
+ * int32_t skLength = collator.getSortKey(name, sk, skCapacity);
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * <li>The client would put the name (and associated information) into its bucket for bucketIndex. The sort key sk is a
+ * sequence of bytes that can be compared with a binary compare, and produce the right localized result.</li>
+ * </ul>

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B icupkg
+reads the input ICU
+.B .dat
+package file, modify it according to the options,
+swap it to the desired platform properties (charset & endianness),
+and optionally write the resulting ICU
+.B .dat
+package to the output file.
+Items are removed, then added, then extracted and listed.
+An ICU
+.B .dat
+package is written if items are removed or added,
+or if the input and output filenames differ,
+or if the
+.BR "\-w\fP, \fB\-\-writepkg"
+option is set.
+.PP
+If the input filename is "new" then an empty package is created.
+If the output filename is missing, then it is automatically generated
+from the input filename. If the input filename ends with an l, b, or e
+matching its platform properties, then the output filename will
+contain the letter from the
+.BI "\-t\fP, \fB\-\-type"
+option.
+.PP
+This tool can also be used to just swap a single ICU data file, replacing the
+former icuswap tool. For this mode, provide the infilename (and optional
+outfilename) for a non-package ICU data file.
+Allowed options include
+.BI "\-t\fP, \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-s\fP"
+and
+.BI \-d
+.
+The filenames can be absolute, or relative to the source/dest dir paths.
+Other options are not allowed in this mode.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.BR "\-h\fP, \fB\-?\fP, \fB\-\-help"
+Print help about usage and exit.
+.TP
+.BI "\-tl\fP, \fB\-\-type" " l"
+Output for little-endian/ASCII charset family.
+The output type defaults to the input type.
+.TP
+.BI "\-tb\fP, \fB\-\-type" " b"
+Output for big-endian/ASCII charset family.
+The output type defaults to the input type.
+.TP
+.BI "\-te\fP, \fB\-\-type" " e"
+Output for big-endian/EBCDIC charset family.
+The output type defaults to the input type.
+.TP
+.BR \-c\fP, \fB\-\-copyright
+Include the ICU copyright notice in the resulting data.
+.TP
+.BI "\-C\fP, \fB\-\-comment" " comment"
+Include the specified
+.I comment
+in the resulting data instead of the ICU copyright notice. 
+.TP
+.BI "\-a\fP, \fB\-\-add" " list"
+Add items from the
+.I list
+to the package. The list can be a single filename with a
+.B .txt
+file extension containing a list of item filenames, or an ICU
+.B .dat
+package filename.
+.TP
+.BI "\-r\fP, \fB\-\-remove" " list"
+Remove items from the
+.I list
+from the package. The list can be a single filename with a
+.B .txt
+file extension containing a list of item filenames, or an ICU
+.B .dat
+package filename.
+.TP
+.BI "\-x\fP, \fB\-\-extract" " list"
+Extract items from the
+.I list
+from the package. The list can be a single filename with a
+.B .txt
+file extension containing a list of item filenames, or an ICU
+.B .dat
+package filename.
+.TP
+.BI "\-m\fP, \fB\-\-matchmode" " mode"
+Set the matching mode for item names with wildcards.
+.TP
+.BI "\-s\fP, \fB\-\-sourcedir" " source"
+Set the source directory to
+.IR source .
+The default source directory is the current directory.
+.TP
+.BI "\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destdir" " destination"
+Set the destination directory to
+.IR destination .
+The default destination directory is the current directory.
+.TP
+.BI "\-l\fP, \fB\-\-list"
+List the package items to stdout (after modifying the package).
+.SH LIST FILE SYNTAX
+Items are listed on one or more lines and separated by whitespace (space+tab).
+Comments begin with
+.B #
+and are ignored. Empty lines are ignored. Lines where the first non-whitespace
+character is one of "%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?_ are also ignored
+to reserve for future syntax.
+.PP
+Items for removal or extraction may contain a single 
+.B *
+wildcard character. The 
+.B *
+matches zero or more characters. If
+.BI "\-m\fP, \fB\-\-matchmode" " noslash"
+is set, then the
+.B *
+character does not match the
+.B /
+character.
+.PP
+Items must be listed relative to the package, and the
+.B "\fB\-\-sourcedir"
+or the
+.B "\fB\-\-destdir"
+path will be prepended. The paths are only prepended to item
+filenames while adding or extracting items, not to ICU .dat package or list
+filenames.
+.PP
+Paths may contain
+.B /
+instead of the platform's file separator character and are converted as
+appropriate.
