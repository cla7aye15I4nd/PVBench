+/**
+ * AlphabeticIndex supports the creation of a UI index appropriate for a given language.
+ * It can support either direct use, or use with a client that doesn't support localized collation.
+ * The following is an example of what an index might look like in a UI:
+ * 
+ * <pre>
+ *  <b>... A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  ...</b>
+ *
+ *  <b>A</b>
+ *     Addison
+ *     Albertson
+ *     Azensky
+ *  <b>B</b>
+ *     Baker
+ *  ...
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * The class can generate a list of labels for use as a UI "index", that is, a list of
+ * clickable characters (or character sequences) that allow the user to see a segment
+ * (bucket) of a larger "target" list. That is, each label corresponds to a bucket in
+ * the target list, where everything in the bucket is greater than or equal to the character
+ * (according to the locale's collation). Strings can be added to the index;
+ * they will be in sorted order in the right bucket.
+ * <p>
+ * The class also supports having buckets for strings before the first (underflow),
+ * after the last (overflow), and between scripts (inflow). For example, if the index
+ * is constructed with labels for Russian and English, Greek characters would fall
+ * into an inflow bucket between the other two scripts.
+ * <p>
+ * The AlphabeticIndex class is not intended for public subclassing.
+ *
+ * <p><em>Note:</em> If you expect to have a lot of ASCII or Latin characters
+ * as well as characters from the user's language,
+ * then it is a good idea to call addLabels(Locale::getEnglish(), status).</p>
+ *
+ * <h2>Direct Use</h2>
+ * <p>The following shows an example of building an index directly.
+ *  The "show..." methods below are just to illustrate usage.
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * // Create a simple index.  "Item" is assumed to be an application
+ * // defined type that the application's UI and other processing knows about,
+ * //  and that has a name.
+ *
+ * UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
+ * AlphabeticIndex index = new AlphabeticIndex(desiredLocale, status);
+ * index->addLabels(additionalLocale, status);
+ * for (Item *item in some source of Items ) {
+ *     index->addRecord(item->name(), item, status);
+ * }
+ * ...
+ * // Show index at top. We could skip or gray out empty buckets
+ *
+ * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
+ *     if (showAll || index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
+ *         showLabelAtTop(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
+ *     }
+ * }
+ *  ...
+ * // Show the buckets with their contents, skipping empty buckets
+ *
+ * index->resetBucketIterator(status);
+ * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
+ *    if (index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
+ *        showLabelInList(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
+ *        while (index->nextRecord(status)) {
+ *            showIndexedItem(UI, static_cast<Item *>(index->getRecordData()))
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * The caller can build different UIs using this class.
+ * For example, an index character could be omitted or grayed-out
+ * if its bucket is empty. Small buckets could also be combined based on size, such as:
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * <b>... A-F G-N O-Z ...</b>
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * <h2>Client Support</h2>
+ * <p>Callers can also use the AlphabeticIndex::ImmutableIndex, or the AlphabeticIndex itself,
+ * to support sorting on a client that doesn't support AlphabeticIndex functionality.
+ *
+ * <p>The ImmutableIndex is both immutable and thread-safe.
+ * The corresponding AlphabeticIndex methods are not thread-safe because
+ * they "lazily" build the index buckets.
+ * <ul>
+ * <li>ImmutableIndex.getBucket(index) provides random access to all
+ *     buckets and their labels and label types.
+ * <li>The AlphabeticIndex bucket iterator or ImmutableIndex.getBucket(0..getBucketCount-1)
+ *     can be used to get a list of the labels,
+ *     such as "...", "A", "B",..., and send that list to the client.
+ * <li>When the client has a new name, it sends that name to the server.
+ * The server needs to call the following methods,
+ * and communicate the bucketIndex and collationKey back to the client.
+ *
+ * <pre>
+ * int32_t bucketIndex = index.getBucketIndex(name, status);
+ * const UnicodeString &label = immutableIndex.getBucket(bucketIndex)->getLabel();  // optional
+ * int32_t skLength = collator.getSortKey(name, sk, skCapacity);
+ * </pre>
+ *
+ * <li>The client would put the name (and associated information) into its bucket for bucketIndex. The sort key sk is a
+ * sequence of bytes that can be compared with a binary compare, and produce the right localized result.</li>
+ * </ul>

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B pkgdata
+takes a set of data files and packages them for use by ICU or
+applications that use ICU. The typical reason to package files using
+.B pkgdata
+is to make their distribution easier and their loading by ICU faster
+and less consuming of limited system resources such as file
+descriptors.
+Packaged data also allow applications to be distributed with fewer
+resource files, or even with none at all if they link against the
+packaged data directly.
+.PP
+.B pkgdata
+supports a few different methods of packaging data that serve
+different purposes.
+.PP
+The default packaging
+.I mode
+is
+.BR common ,
+or
+.BR archive .
+In this mode, the different data files are bundled together as an
+architecture-dependent file that can later be memory mapped for use by
+ICU. Data packaged using this mode will be looked up under the ICU
+data directory. Such packaging is easy to use for applications resource
+bundles, for example, as long as the application can install the
+packaged file in the ICU data directory.
+.PP
+Another packaging mode is the
+.BR dll ,
+or
+.BR library ,
+mode, where the data files are compiled into a shared library. ICU
+used to be able to dynamically load these shared libraries, but as of
+ICU 2.0, such support has been removed. This mode is still useful for
+two main purposes: to build ICU itself, as the ICU data is packaged as
+a shared library by default; and to build resource bundles that are
+linked to the application that uses them. Such resource bundles can
+then be placed anywhere where the system's dynamic linker will be
+looking for shared libraries, instead of being forced to live inside
+the ICU data directory.
+.PP
+The
+.BR static
+packaging mode is similar to the shared library one except that it
+produces a static library.
+.\" Note that many platforms are not able to
+.\" dynamically load symbols from static object files, so for this reason
+.\" .BR udata_setAppData() 
+.\" must be called
+.\" to install this data. As a convenience, pkgdata will build a C source file
+.\" and a header file. Given a data package named
+.\" .IR name, in the output 
+.\" directory will be created
+.\" .IR name .c
+.\" and
+.\" .IR name .h with the single
+.\" function
+.\" .BR "udata_install_\fcIname\fB(UErrorCode *err)" ,
+.\" where
+.\" .I cname
+.\" is
+.\" .I name
+.\" turned into a valid C identifier.
+.\" The application need to call this function once. The error code returned
+.\" is that of
+.\" .BR udata_setAppData() .
+.\" .PP
+.\" Data pakackaged in a library, whether shared or static, 
+.\" Subsequently, the application can access this data by passing
+.\" .I name for the
+.\" .I path 
+.\" rgument to functions such as
+.\" .BR Bures_open() .
+.PP
+Finally,
+.B pkgdata
+supports a
+.B files
+mode which simply copies the data files instead of packaging
+them as a single file or library. This mode is mainly intended to
+provide support for building ICU before it is packaged as separate
+small packages for distribution with operating systems such as Debian
+GNU/Linux for example. Please refer to the packaging documentation in
+the ICU source distribution for further information on the use of this
+mode.
+.PP
+.B pkgdata
+builds, packages, installs, or cleans the appropriate data based on the options given
+without the need to call GNU
+.BR make
+anymore.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B uconv
+converts, or transcodes, each given
+.I file
+(or its standard input if no
+.I file
+is specified) from one
+.I encoding
+to another. 
+The transcoding is done using Unicode as a pivot encoding
+(i.e. the data are first transcoded from their original encoding to
+Unicode, and then from Unicode to the destination encoding).
+.PP
+If an
+.I encoding
+is not specified or is
+.BR - ,
+the default encoding is used. Thus, calling
+.B uconv
+with no
+.I encoding
+provides an easy way to validate and sanitize data files for
+further consumption by tools requiring data in the default encoding.
+.PP
+When calling
+.BR uconv ,
+it is possible to specify callbacks that are used to handle invalid
+characters in the input, or characters that cannot be transcoded to
+the destination encoding. Some encodings, for example, offer a default
+substitution character that can be used to represent the occurrence of
+such characters in the input. Other callbacks offer a useful visual
+representation of the invalid data.
+.PP
+.B uconv
+can also run the specified
+.IR transliteration
+on the transcoded data,
+in which case transliteration will happen as an intermediate step,
+after the data have been transcoded to Unicode.
+The
+.I transliteration
+can be either a list of semicolon-separated transliterator names,
+or an arbitrarily complex set of rules in the ICU transliteration
+rules format.
+.PP
+For transcoding purposes,
+.B uconv
+options are compatible with those of
+.BR iconv (1),
+making it easy to replace it in scripts. It is not necessarily the case,
+however, that the encoding names used by
+.B uconv
+and ICU are the same as the ones used by
+.BR iconv (1).
+Also, options that provide informational data, such as the
+.B \-l\fP, \fB\-\-list
+one offered by some 
+.BR iconv (1)
+variants such as GNU's, produce data in a slightly different and
+easier to parse format.
+.SH OPTIONS

+.B uconv
+supports specifying callbacks to handle invalid data. Callbacks can be
+set for both directions of transcoding: from the original encoding to
+Unicode, with the
+.BR "\-\-from\-callback"
+option, and from Unicode to the destination encoding, with the
+.BR "\-\-to\-callback"
+option.
+.PP
+The following is a list of valid
+.I callback
+names, along with a description of their behavior. The list of
+callbacks actually supported by
+.B uconv
+is displayed when it is called with
+.BR "\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help" .
+.PP
+.TP \w'\fBescape-unicode'u+3n
+.B substitute
+Write the encoding's substitute sequence, or the Unicode
+replacement character
+.B U+FFFD
+when transcoding to Unicode.
+.TP
+.B skip
+Ignore the invalid data.
+.TP
+.B stop
+Stop with an error when encountering invalid data.
+This is the default callback.
+.TP
+.B escape
+Same as
+.BR escape-icu .
+.TP
+.B escape-icu
+Replace the missing characters with a string of the format
+.BR %U\fIhhhh\fP
+for plane 0 characters, and
+.BR %U\fIhhhh\fP%U\fIhhhh\fP
+for planes 1 and above characters,
+where
+.I hhhh
+is the hexadecimal value of one of the UTF-16 code units representing the

+UTF-16 surrogate code units.
+.TP
+.B escape-java

+.BR \eu\fIhhhh\fP
+for plane 0 characters, and
+.BR \eu\fIhhhh\fP\eu\fIhhhh\fP
+for planes 1 and above characters,
+where
+.I hhhh
+is the hexadecimal value of one of the UTF-16 code units representing the
+character. Characters from planes 1 and above are written as a pair of
+UTF-16 surrogate code units.
+.TP
+.B escape-c
+Replace the missing characters with a string of the format
+.BR \eu\fIhhhh\fP
+for plane 0 characters, and
+.BR \eU\fIhhhhhhhh\fP
+for planes 1 and above characters,
+where
+.I hhhh
+and
+.I hhhhhhhh
+are the hexadecimal values of the Unicode codepoint.
+.TP
+.B escape-xml
+Same as
+.BR escape-xml-hex .
+.TP

+That hexadecimal string is of variable length and can use from 4 to
+6 digits.
+This is the format universally used to denote a Unicode codepoint in
+the literature, delimited by curly braces for easy recognition of those
+substitutions in the output.

+.SH CAVEATS AND BUGS
+.B uconv
+does report errors as occurring at the first invalid byte
+encountered. This may be confusing to users of GNU
+.BR iconv (1),
+which reports errors as occurring at the first byte of an invalid
+sequence. For multi-byte character sets or encodings, this means that
+.BR uconv
+error positions may be at a later offset in the input stream than
+would be the case with GNU
+.BR iconv (1).
+.PP
+The reporting of error positions when a transliterator is used may be
+inaccurate or unavailable, in which case
+.BR uconv
+will report the offset in the output stream at which the error
+occurred.
