[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a undefined behavior vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program exhibits undefined behavior, leading to unpredictable results or crashes. Here is the detail: \n\nruntime error: negation of -2147483648 cannot be represented in type 'int32_t' (aka 'int'); cast to an unsigned type to negate this value to itself\n    - icu_75::Calendar::add(UCalendarDateFields, int, UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:2160:22\n    - main poc.cpp:39:15\n\nSUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior .././icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:2160:22 \n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Review the code for undefined behavior patterns and correct them.\n2. Check for type mismatches, signed integer overflows, and other undefined behavior triggers.\n"}]
