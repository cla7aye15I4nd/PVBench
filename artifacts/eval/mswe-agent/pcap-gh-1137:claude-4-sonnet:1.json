[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 350 at 0x735ab8084b20 thread T0\n    - pcpp::DnsResource::setData(pcpp::IDnsResourceData*) Packet++/src/DnsResource.cpp:457:2\n    - pcpp::DnsLayer::addResource(pcpp::DnsResourceType, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>> const&, pcpp::DnsType, pcpp::DnsClass, unsigned int, pcpp::IDnsResourceData*) Packet++/src/DnsLayer.cpp:492:20\n    - pcpp::DnsLayer::addAnswer(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>> const&, pcpp::DnsType, pcpp::DnsClass, unsigned int, pcpp::IDnsResourceData*) Packet++/src/DnsLayer.cpp:653:21\n    - main poc.cpp:15:36\n\nAddress 0x735ab8084b20 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 288 in frame\n    - pcpp::DnsLayer::addResource(pcpp::DnsResourceType, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>> const&, pcpp::DnsType, pcpp::DnsClass, unsigned int, pcpp::IDnsResourceData*) Packet++/src/DnsLayer.cpp:476:0\n\n  This frame has 1 object(s):\n    [32, 288) 'newResourceRawData' (line 478) <== Memory access at offset 288 overflows this variable\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n"}]
