[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Disassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.\n    - zif_range ext/standard/array.c:2964:7\n    - ZEND_DO_ICALL_SPEC_RETVAL_USED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:1337:2\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:57007:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:61604:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1881:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2501:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:966:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1340:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
