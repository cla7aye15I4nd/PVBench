[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a null dereference vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempts to dereference a null pointer, causing a segmentation fault or crash. Here is the detail: \n\nHint: pc points to the zero page.\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: address points to the zero page.\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:55866:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:60439:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1840:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2578:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:964:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1333:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
