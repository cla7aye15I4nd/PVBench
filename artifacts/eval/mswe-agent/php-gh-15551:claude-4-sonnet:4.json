[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Disassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.\n    - php_dom_iterator_move_forward ext/dom/dom_iterators.c:200:32\n    - zim_InternalIterator_next Zend/zend_interfaces.c:600:2\n    - ZEND_DO_FCALL_SPEC_RETVAL_UNUSED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:1842:4\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:55866:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:60439:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1840:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2578:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:964:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1333:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
