[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program tried to access a heap object outside of its allocated memory, causing potential memory corruption or crashes. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 1 at 0x50d0000bae00 thread T0\n    - zim_SplObjectStorage_serialize ext/spl/spl_observer.c:793:23\n    - ZEND_DO_FCALL_SPEC_RETVAL_USED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:1951:4\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:55866:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:60439:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1842:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2578:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:964:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1334:18\n\n0x50d0000bae00 is located 8 bytes after 136-byte region [0x50d0000bad70,0x50d0000badf8)\nallocated by thread T0 here:\n    - tracked_malloc Zend/zend_alloc.c:2832:14\n    - _malloc_custom Zend/zend_alloc.c:2477:10\n    - _emalloc Zend/zend_alloc.c:2596:10\n    - spl_object_storage_new_ex ext/spl/spl_observer.c:273:11\n    - spl_SplObjectStorage_new ext/spl/spl_observer.c:420:9\n    - _object_and_properties_init Zend/zend_API.c:1705:3\n    - object_init_ex Zend/zend_API.c:1719:9\n    - ZEND_NEW_SPEC_CONST_UNUSED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:10309:6\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:55866:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:60439:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1842:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2578:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:964:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1334:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n"}]
