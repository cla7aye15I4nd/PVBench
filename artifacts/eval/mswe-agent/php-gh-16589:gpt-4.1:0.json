[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a memory leak vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A program fails to free allocated memory, leading to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time. Here is the detail: \n\n\nDirect leak of 32 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:\n    - tracked_malloc Zend/zend_alloc.c:2832:14\n    - _malloc_custom Zend/zend_alloc.c:2477:10\n    - _emalloc_32 Zend/zend_alloc.c:2526:1\n    - spl_ptr_llist_push ext/spl/spl_dllist.c:182:32\n    - zim_SplDoublyLinkedList_add ext/spl/spl_dllist.c:1198:3\n    - ZEND_DO_FCALL_SPEC_RETVAL_UNUSED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:1842:4\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:55866:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:60439:2\n    - zend_execute_scripts Zend/zend.c:1842:4\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2578:13\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:964:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1334:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure that every memory allocation has a corresponding deallocation.\n2. Track allocated memory systematically to avoid leaks.\n3. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations by reusing buffers where possible."}]
