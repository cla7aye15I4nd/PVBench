[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: \n\nThe signal is caused by a READ memory access.\nHint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Disassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.\n    - zend_string_hash_val Zend/zend_string.h:141:9\n    - zend_hash_find Zend/zend_hash.c:2674:8\n    - php_get_session_var ext/session/session.c:221:10\n    - ps_srlzr_encode_php ext/session/session.c:1085:17\n    - php_session_encode ext/session/session.c:258:10\n    - zif_session_encode ext/session/session.c:2611:8\n    - ZEND_DO_ICALL_SPEC_RETVAL_USED_HANDLER Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:1351:2\n    - execute_ex Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:58554:7\n    - zend_execute Zend/zend_vm_execute.h:64206:2\n    - zend_execute_script Zend/zend.c:1934:3\n    - php_execute_script_ex main/main.c:2574:13\n    - php_execute_script main/main.c:2614:9\n    - do_cli sapi/cli/php_cli.c:935:5\n    - main sapi/cli/php_cli.c:1310:18\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.\n2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.\n3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences."}]
