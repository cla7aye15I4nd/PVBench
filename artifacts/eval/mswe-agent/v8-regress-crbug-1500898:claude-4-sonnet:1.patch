+# Fix for Reachable Assertion in V8 Isolate::ReThrow
+
+## Problem Description
+The V8 engine was experiencing a debug assertion failure in src/execution/isolate.cc at line 1925:
+Fatal error in ../../src/execution/isolate.cc, line 1925
+Debug check failed: !has_pending_message().
+
+## Root Cause Analysis
+The issue occurred in the two-parameter ReThrow method:
+The assertion DCHECK(!has_pending_message()) was too strict. It expected that there should be no pending message when the method is called, but in practice:
+
+1. Runtime_ReThrowWithMessage (in src/runtime/runtime-internal.cc) calls this method
+2. There might already be a pending message in the isolate when this happens
+3. The assertion would fail, causing a fatal error
+
+## Solution
+Removed the overly strict assertion DCHECK(!has_pending_message()) because:
+
+1. It's unnecessary: We're explicitly setting a new message with set_pending_message(message) anyway
+2. It's inconsistent: The single-parameter ReThrow method doesn't have this restriction
+3. It's incorrect: Runtime functions should be able to set new messages regardless of existing state
+4. The behavior is correct: Overwriting an existing pending message with a new one is the expected behavior
+
+## Code Changes
+File: src/execution/isolate.cc
+Lines: 1922-1930
+
+The problematic assertion DCHECK(!has_pending_message()) has been removed and replaced with a comment explaining why it's not needed.
+
+## Impact
+- Fixes the fatal assertion error when re-throwing exceptions with messages
+- Maintains correct behavior: new messages properly overwrite existing ones
+- No functional changes to the API or expected behavior
+- Only affects debug builds (assertions are typically disabled in release builds)
+
+## Testing
+The fix addresses the specific crash scenario described in the issue where Runtime_ReThrowWithMessage would trigger the assertion failure when there was already a pending message in the isolate.
