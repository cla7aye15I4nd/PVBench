[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a global buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A buffer overflow occurs in globally allocated memory, leading to memory corruption or crashes. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 1 at 0x5e81be0bcd16 thread T0\n    - main src/xxd/xxd.c:1116:11\n\n0x5e81be0bcd16 is located 0 bytes after global variable 'main.l' defined in '/tmp/vim-gh-14738/build/src/xxd/xxd.c:673' (0x5e81be0bb380) of size 6550\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n"}]
