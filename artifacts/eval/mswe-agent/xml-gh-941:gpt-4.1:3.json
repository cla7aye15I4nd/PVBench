[{"patch": null, "error": "The sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 1 at 0x7d15f9d012c4 thread T0\n    - xmllintShell shell.c:1133:26\n    - parseAndPrintFile xmllint.c:1858:9\n    - xmllintMain xmllint.c:3264:21\n    - main lintmain.c:13:12\n\nAddress 0x7d15f9d012c4 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 708 in frame\n    - xmllintShell shell.c:1069:0\n\n  This frame has 5 object(s):\n    [32, 532) 'prompt' (line 1070)\n    [608, 708) 'command' (line 1072) <== Memory access at offset 708 overflows this variable\n    [752, 1152) 'arg' (line 1073)\n    [1216, 1716) 'dir' (line 1221)\n    [1792, 2292) 'dir523' (line 1383)\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n"}]
