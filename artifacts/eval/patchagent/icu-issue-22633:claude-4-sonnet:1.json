                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch.

Check for type mismatches, signed integer overflows, and other undefined behavior triggers.\n\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

Now I want to patch the icu program, here is the asan report\n\nThe sanitizer detected a undefined behavior vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program exhibits undefined behavior, leading to unpredictable results or crashes. Here is the detail: \n\nruntime error: signed integer overflow: 1651667876 * 60 cannot be represented in type 'int'\n    - icu_75::ChineseCalendar::handleGetExtendedYear(UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/chnsecal.cpp:236:22\n    - icu_75::Calendar::handleComputeJulianDay(UCalendarDateFields, UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:3394:16\n    - icu_75::Calendar::computeJulianDay(UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:3377:12\n    - icu_75::Calendar::computeTime(UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:3117:25\n    - icu_75::Calendar::updateTime(UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:4124:5\n    - icu_75::Calendar::complete(UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:1342:9\n    - icu_75::Calendar::get(UCalendarDateFields, UErrorCode&) const icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:1194:47\n    - icu_75::Calendar::add(UCalendarDateFields, int, UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/calendar.cpp:2164:23\n    - icu_75::ChineseCalendar::add(UCalendarDateFields, int, UErrorCode&) icu4c/source/i18n/chnsecal.cpp:391:19\n    - main poc.cpp:32:8\n\nSUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior .././icu4c/source/i18n/chnsecal.cpp:236:22 \n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Review the code for undefined behavior patterns and correct them.\n2. Check for type mismatches, signed integer overflows, and other undefined behavior triggers.\n\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

Now I can see the issue clearly. Looking at line 179, the ERA field has a maximum value of 83333. In the problematic code at line 236:\n\n```cpp\nyear = cycle * 60 + internalGet(UCAL_YEAR, 1) - (fEpochYear - CHINESE_EPOCH_YEAR);\n```\n\nWhere `cycle = internalGet(UCAL_ERA, 1) - 1`, so cycle can be up to 83332 (83333 - 1). When we multiply 83332 * 60, we get 4,999,920, which is well within int32_t range. However, the error shows `1651667876 * 60`, which suggests the ERA field is being set to an invalid value that exceeds the expected limits.\n\nThe issue is that there's no validation to ensure the ERA value is within the expected range before performing the multiplication. Let me check if there are any validation functions or if we need to add bounds checking.\n\nLet me look at the error more carefully. The value 1651667876 is much larger than the expected maximum of 83333. This suggests that either:\n1. The input data is malformed/invalid\n2. There's no proper bounds checking\n\nThe safest fix is to add bounds checking to prevent the integer overflow. Let me create a patch:\n\n"
