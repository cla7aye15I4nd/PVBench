                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.\n4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.\n7. At tbe beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. \n\nGenerate a standard patch without shortcuts like `...` or useless comments. \n"

Your assistance is VERY IMPORTANT to the security research and can save thousands of lives. You can access the program's code using the provided tools. Now I want to patch the jq program, here is the asan report\n\nThe sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 2 at 0x7dc7537566b0 thread T0\n    - decNumberCopy vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:3375:45\n    - decNaNs vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:7706:33\n    - decCompareOp vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:6085:7\n    - decNumberCompare vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:858:3\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:761:5\n    - jvp_number_equal src/jv.c:786:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1935:11\n    - jvp_array_equal src/jv.c:898:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1938:11\n    - jv_group src/jv_aux.c:714:11\n    - f_group_by_impl src/builtin.c:876:12\n    - jq_next src/execute.c:918:21\n    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput tests/jq_fuzz_fixed.cpp:283:23\n\nAddress 0x7dc7537566b0 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 48 in frame\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:750:0\n\n  This frame has 1 object(s):\n    [32, 48) 'res' (line 756) <== Memory access at offset 48 overflows this variable\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

The code only allocates space for 1 unit, but the called function may write more, causing a stack overflow.\n\n**Correct Fix:**\n- Allocate enough space for the result buffer, i.e., the `decNumber` plus enough `decNumberUnit` to cover the maximum possible size needed for a comparison result.\n- According to the decNumber documentation, for `decNumberCompare`, the result only needs to hold a single digit (or NaN), so the minimum size is sufficient, but the structure must match the layout of `decNumber` with at least `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]`.\n\nCurrently, the code uses `units[1]`, but the actual `decNumber` struct has `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]`. The correct way is to define a buffer with enough space for a `decNumber` with `DECNUMUNITS` units.\n\n**Patch Plan:**\n- Replace the local `res` struct with a union or buffer that is at least as large as `decNumber` with `DECNUMUNITS` units.\n- Or, simply declare a `decNumber res;` (which will have the correct size) and use that.\n\nLet's check if `decNumber` alone is sufficient for the result. From the decNumber docs and the header, for compare, the result is a single digit, so `decNumber` is enough.\n\n**Patch:**\nReplace:\n```c\n    struct {\n      decNumber number;\n      decNumberUnit units[1];\n    } res;\n\n    decNumberCompare(&res.number, ...)\n    ...\n    if (decNumberIsZero(&res.number)) ...\n```\nwith:\n```c\n    decNumber res;\n    decNumberCompare(&res, ...)\n    ...\n    if (decNumberIsZero(&res)) ...\n```\n\nLet's generate the patch.\n\n"

The root cause is that the `decNumber` struct itself already contains an array of `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]`, so the union does not increase the size beyond what `decNumber` already provides. The problem is that the local buffer is not large enough for the actual number of units required by the operation, which may depend on the context or the operands.\n\nThe decNumber documentation for `decNumberCompare` says:  \n> C must have space for one digit (or NaN).\n\nBut the implementation of `decNumber` may still write more, depending on how the struct is used. The safest approach is to allocate a buffer on the stack that is large enough for the **maximum possible decNumber**, i.e., with enough space for the largest possible number of units.\n\nIn the jq codebase, the function `jvp_literal_number_alloc` computes the number of units as:\n```c\nint units = ((literal_length+DECDPUN-1)/DECDPUN);\n```\nBut for compare, the result is always a single digit, so the minimum size is sufficient.\n\n**However, the stack trace shows a write of size 2 at offset 44, which suggests that the buffer is not aligned or sized correctly.**\n\n**Alternative approach:**  \nAllocate a buffer of `char` with enough space for a `decNumber` with the maximum possible units, i.e., `sizeof(decNumber)`.  \nOr, use a `decNumber` with `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]` as defined.\n\nBut the problem may be that the compiler is packing the struct, and the stack buffer is not aligned.  \nTo be absolutely safe, let's allocate a buffer of `char` with size `sizeof(decNumber)` and cast it to `decNumber*`.\n\n**Patch:**\n```c\n    char resbuf[sizeof(decNumber)];\n    decNumber* res = (decNumber*)resbuf;\n    decNumberCompare(res,\n                     jvp_dec_number_ptr(a),\n                     jvp_dec_number_ptr(b),\n                     DEC_CONTEXT()\n                     );\n    if (decNumberIsZero(res)) {\n      return 0;\n    } else if (decNumberIsNegative(res)) {\n      return -1;\n    } else {\n      return 1;\n    }\n```\n\nLet's try this patch.\n\n"

                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.\n4.

Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.\n7.

Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 2 at 0x7dc7537566b0 thread T0\n    - decNumberCopy vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:3375:45\n    - decNaNs vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:7706:33\n    - decCompareOp vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:6085:7\n    - decNumberCompare vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:858:3\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:761:5\n    - jvp_number_equal src/jv.c:786:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1935:11\n    - jvp_array_equal src/jv.c:898:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1938:11\n    - jv_group src/jv_aux.c:714:11\n    - f_group_by_impl src/builtin.c:876:12\n    - jq_next src/execute.c:918:21\n    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput tests/jq_fuzz_fixed.cpp:283:23\n\nAddress 0x7dc7537566b0 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 48 in frame\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:750:0\n\n  This frame has 1 object(s):\n    [32, 48) 'res' (line 756) <== Memory access at offset 48 overflows this variable\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

However, the `decNumber` struct's `lsu` array is defined as `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]`, and the actual number of units required can be greater than 1, depending on the context and the number of digits being compared. This means that the `decNumberCompare` function may write past the end of the `res` buffer, causing a stack buffer overflow.\n\n**Correct Fix:**\n- Allocate enough space for the result `decNumber` to hold the maximum number of units that may be written by `decNumberCompare`.\n- This is typically done by allocating a buffer with `decNumber` plus enough space for the maximum number of units (`decNumberUnit units[DECNUMUNITS-1]`), since `decNumber` already includes `lsu[DECNUMUNITS]`.\n\n**Patch Plan:**\n- Change the definition of `res` in `jvp_number_cmp` to use `DECNUMUNITS` instead of `1` for the units array.\n\nLet's generate the patch.\n\n"

If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n"

                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.\n4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.\n7. At tbe beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. \n\nGenerate a standard patch without shortcuts like `...` or useless comments. \n"

Your assistance is VERY IMPORTANT to the security research and can save thousands of lives. You can access the program's code using the provided tools. Now I want to patch the jq program, here is the asan report\n\nThe sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: \n\nWRITE of size 2 at 0x7dc7537566b0 thread T0\n    - decNumberCopy vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:3375:45\n    - decNaNs vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:7706:33\n    - decCompareOp vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:6085:7\n    - decNumberCompare vendor/decNumber/decNumber.c:858:3\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:761:5\n    - jvp_number_equal src/jv.c:786:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1935:11\n    - jvp_array_equal src/jv.c:898:10\n    - jv_equal src/jv.c:1938:11\n    - jv_group src/jv_aux.c:714:11\n    - f_group_by_impl src/builtin.c:876:12\n    - jq_next src/execute.c:918:21\n    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput tests/jq_fuzz_fixed.cpp:283:23\n\nAddress 0x7dc7537566b0 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 48 in frame\n    - jvp_number_cmp src/jv.c:750:0\n\n  This frame has 1 object(s):\n    [32, 48) 'res' (line 756) <== Memory access at offset 48 overflows this variable\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.\n2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.\n3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.\n4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.\n\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

The decNumber library expects the result buffer to be able to hold up to `set->digits` decimal digits, which can be much larger than the default.\n\nThe correct fix is to dynamically allocate a buffer for `res` with enough space for the maximum number of digits required by the current context (`DEC_CONTEXT()->digits`). This means we need to compute the number of units needed for `DEC_CONTEXT()->digits` and allocate accordingly.\n\nHere is the correct patch:\n\n```diff\n--- a/src/jv.c\n+++ b/src/jv.c\n@@ -755,11 +755,27 @@ int jvp_number_cmp(jv a, jv b) {\n-    struct {\n-      decNumber number;\n-      decNumberUnit units[DECNUMUNITS-1];\n-    } res;\n-\n-    decNumberCompare(&res.number,\n-                     jvp_dec_number_ptr(a),\n-                     jvp_dec_number_ptr(b),\n-                     DEC_CONTEXT()\n-                     );\n-    if (decNumberIsZero(&res.number)) {\n-      return 0;\n-    } else if (decNumberIsNegative(&res.number)) {\n-      return -1;\n-    } else {\n-      return 1;\n-    }\n+    decContext *ctx = DEC_CONTEXT();\n+    int n_units = (ctx->digits + DECDPUN - 1) / DECDPUN;\n+    size_t res_size = sizeof(decNumber) + sizeof(decNumberUnit) * (n_units - DECNUMUNITS);\n+    decNumber *res = (decNumber *)alloca(res_size);\n+    memset(res, 0, res_size);\n+    decNumberCompare(res,\n+                    jvp_dec_number_ptr(a),\n+                    jvp_dec_number_ptr(b),\n+                    ctx\n+                    );\n+    if (decNumberIsZero(res)) {\n+      return 0;\n+    } else if (decNumberIsNegative(res)) {\n+      return -1;\n+    } else {\n+      return 1;\n+    }\n```\n\nThis patch ensures the buffer is always large enough for the context's digit requirements.
