                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.\n4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.\n7. At tbe beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. \n\nGenerate a standard patch without shortcuts like `...` or useless comments. \n"

Set pointers to NULL immediately after freeing them to prevent accidental reuse.\n2. Ensure that each allocated memory block is freed only once.\n3. Track memory allocations and deallocations systematically to prevent use-after-free conditions.\n4. Consider swap the order of freeing memory and accessing it.\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

                "message": "\nYour task is to patch the bug in the program as identified by the sanitizer report. Access the buggy C/C++ codebase and the corresponding sanitizer report highlighting various issues. Your objective is to analyze and efficiently patch these issues.\n\nBegin by reviewing the sanitizer report to identify specific problems, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or use-after-free errors. Then, delve into the codebase to locate the exact code sections where these issues occur. Understanding the context and functionality of the problematic code is crucial to determine the best fix. Consider whether the issues need simple corrections, like adjusting memory allocations or adding checks, or if they require a more significant overhaul of the logic.\n\nAfter identifying solutions, modify the code accordingly, ensuring adherence to C/C++ best practices. Test your patches thoroughly to confirm resolution of issues without introducing new ones. Document your changes clearly, explaining the necessity of each modification and how it addresses the specific problems identified by the sanitizer. Your goal is to enhance the codebase's security and stability while minimizing new bug risks.\n\nYou have 3 tools available: `viewcode`, `locate` and `validate`.\n- `viewcode` allows you to view a code snippet from a file at a specific tag, helping you understand the project's internal logic rather than just using common patterns for bug fixes. Your should provide 3 arguments:\n\n1. path: the file path of the file you want to view. The patch is the relative path of the file to the project root directory. For example, if you want to view the file `foo.c` in the project root directory, the file path is `foo.c`. If you want to view the file `foo.c` in the directory `bar`, the file path is `bar/foo.c`.\n2. start line: the start line of the code snippet you want to view.\n3. end line: the end line of the code snippet you want to view.\n\nThe return value of `viewcode` is the code snippet you want to view. We will attach the line number to the beginning of each line. For example, if you want to view the code snippet from line 10 to line 20, the return value of `viewcode` will be:\n```c++\n10| int check (char *string) {\n11|    if (string == NULL) {\n12|        return 0;\n13|    }\n14|    return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n15| }\n16|\n17| int main() {\n18|    char *string = NULL;\n19|    check(string);\n20|    return 0;\n```\n \n- `locate` is used to identify symbols. It can accurately pinpoint the location of a symbol, specifying the file and line number where it is defined. For example, if you wish to find the definition of `struct A *pointer` (or `struct A`), you can use `locate` to determine its location.\n\nYou should provide 1 arguments:\n\n1. symbol: Specify the symbol (e.g., function name, struct name, variable name, etc.) whose location you wish to determine.\n\nUsing `locate` in conjunction with `viewcode` can significantly enhance your code navigation efficiency.\n\n- `validate` is used to validate a patch. It replays the Proof of Concept (PoC) and checks if the sanitizer report is resolved. The patch should follow the format generated by the `git diff` command.\n\nExample of a patch format:\n```diff\n--- a/foo.c\n+++ b/foo.c\n@@ -11,7 +11,9 @@\n}\n\nint check (char *string) {\n+   if (string == NULL) {\n+       return 0;\n+   }\n-   return !strcmp(string, \"hello\");\n+   return !strcmp(string, \"hello world\");\n}\nint main() {\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a null check is added to the `check` function, and the comparison string is changed to `hello world`.\n\nPatch format explanation:\n1. `--- a/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the original commit.\n2. `+++ b/foo.c`: The file `foo.c` in the current commit.\n3. `@@ -11,3 +11,6 @@`: The line number of the patch. The number `11`, appearing twice, indicates the first line number of the current commit. The number `3` represents the number of lines in the original commit, and `6` represents the number in the current commit.\n4. Lines with `+` indicate additions in the current commit, the `+` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n5. Lines with `-` indicate deletions in the current commit, the `-` should must located at the beginning of the line.\n6. Lines with ` ` (space) remain unchanged in the current commit.\n7. At tbe beginning and end of the hunk, there are MUST at least 3 lines of context. \n\nGenerate a standard patch without shortcuts like `...` or useless comments. \n"

Here is the detail: \n\nREAD of size 8 at 0x51300001c078 thread T0\n    - Py_TYPE Include/object.h:249:16\n    - list_richcompare_impl Objects/listobject.c:3338:30\n    - list_richcompare Objects/listobject.c:3393:11\n    - do_richcompare Objects/object.c:933:15\n    - PyObject_RichCompare Objects/object.c:976:21\n    - list_richcompare_impl Objects/listobject.c:3385:12\n    - list_richcompare Objects/listobject.c:3393:11\n    - do_richcompare Objects/object.c:927:15\n    - PyObject_RichCompare Objects/object.c:976:21\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault Python/generated_cases.c.h:2218:23\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrame Include/internal/pycore_ceval.h:119:16\n    - _PyEval_Vector Python/ceval.c:1819:12\n    - PyEval_EvalCode Python/ceval.c:599:21\n    - run_eval_code_obj Python/pythonrun.c:1292:9\n    - run_mod Python/pythonrun.c:1377:19\n    - pyrun_file Python/pythonrun.c:1210:15\n    - _PyRun_SimpleFileObject Python/pythonrun.c:459:13\n    - _PyRun_AnyFileObject Python/pythonrun.c:77:15\n    - pymain_run_file_obj Modules/main.c:357:15\n    - pymain_run_file Modules/main.c:376:15\n    - pymain_run_python Modules/main.c:639:21\n    - Py_RunMain Modules/main.c:718:5\n    - pymain_main Modules/main.c:748:12\n    - Py_BytesMain Modules/main.c:772:12\n    - main Programs/python.c:15:12\n\n0x51300001c078 is located 56 bytes inside of 352-byte region [0x51300001c040,0x51300001c1a0)\nfreed by thread T0 here:\n    - _PyMem_RawFree Objects/obmalloc.c:90:5\n    - _PyMem_DebugRawFree Objects/obmalloc.c:2754:5\n    - _PyMem_DebugFree Objects/obmalloc.c:2891:5\n    - PyObject_Free Objects/obmalloc.c:1323:5\n    - PyObject_GC_Del Python/gc.c:2123:5\n    - object_dealloc Objects/typeobject.c:6324:5\n    - subtype_dealloc Objects/typeobject.c:2534:5\n    - _Py_Dealloc Objects/object.c:2854:5\n    - Py_DECREF Include/refcount.h:351:9\n    - Py_XDECREF Include/refcount.h:459:9\n    - _PyFrame_ClearLocals Python/frame.c:104:9\n    - _PyFrame_ClearExceptCode Python/frame.c:129:5\n    - clear_thread_frame Python/ceval.c:1681:5\n    - _PyEval_FrameClearAndPop Python/ceval.c:1708:9\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault Python/generated_cases.c.h:5279:13\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrame Include/internal/pycore_ceval.h:119:16\n    - _PyEval_Vector Python/ceval.c:1819:12\n    - _PyFunction_Vectorcall Objects/call.c:413:16\n    - _PyObject_VectorcallTstate Include/internal/pycore_call.h:168:11\n    - vectorcall_unbound Objects/typeobject.c:2716:12\n    - slot_tp_richcompare Objects/typeobject.c:9812:21\n    - do_richcompare Objects/object.c:927:15\n    - PyObject_RichCompare Objects/object.c:976:21\n    - list_richcompare_impl Objects/listobject.c:3385:12\n    - list_richcompare Objects/listobject.c:3393:11\n    - do_richcompare Objects/object.c:927:15\n    - PyObject_RichCompare Objects/object.c:976:21\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault Python/generated_cases.c.h:2218:23\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrame Include/internal/pycore_ceval.h:119:16\n\npreviously allocated by thread T0 here:\n    - _PyMem_RawMalloc Objects/obmalloc.c:62:12\n    - _PyMem_DebugRawAlloc Objects/obmalloc.c:2686:24\n    - _PyMem_DebugRawMalloc Objects/obmalloc.c:2719:12\n    - _PyMem_DebugMalloc Objects/obmalloc.c:2876:12\n    - PyObject_Malloc Objects/obmalloc.c:1294:12\n    - _PyObject_MallocWithType Include/internal/pycore_object_alloc.h:46:17\n    - _PyType_AllocNoTrack Objects/typeobject.c:2187:19\n    - PyType_GenericAlloc Objects/typeobject.c:2216:21\n    - object_new Objects/typeobject.c:6314:21\n    - type_call Objects/typeobject.c:2131:11\n    - _PyObject_MakeTpCall Objects/call.c:242:18\n    - _PyObject_VectorcallTstate Include/internal/pycore_call.h:166:16\n    - PyObject_Vectorcall Objects/call.c:327:12\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault Python/generated_cases.c.h:813:23\n    - _PyEval_EvalFrame Include/internal/pycore_ceval.h:119:16\n    - _PyEval_Vector Python/ceval.c:1819:12\n    - PyEval_EvalCode Python/ceval.c:599:21\n    - run_eval_code_obj Python/pythonrun.c:1292:9\n    - run_mod Python/pythonrun.c:1377:19\n    - pyrun_file Python/pythonrun.c:1210:15\n    - _PyRun_SimpleFileObject Python/pythonrun.c:459:13\n    - _PyRun_AnyFileObject Python/pythonrun.c:77:15\n    - pymain_run_file_obj Modules/main.c:357:15\n    - pymain_run_file Modules/main.c:376:15\n    - pymain_run_python Modules/main.c:639:21\n    - Py_RunMain Modules/main.c:718:5\n    - pymain_main Modules/main.c:748:12\n    - Py_BytesMain Modules/main.c:772:12\n    - main Programs/python.c:15:12\n\n\nTo fix this issue, follow the advice below:\n\n1. Set pointers to NULL immediately after freeing them to prevent accidental reuse.\n2. Ensure that each allocated memory block is freed only once.\n3. Track memory allocations and deallocations systematically to prevent use-after-free conditions.\n4. Consider swap the order of freeing memory and accessing it.\n\nThe report provides the stack trace of the program. You can use the stack trace to identify a fix point for the bug. Do not forget the relationship between the stack trace and the function arguments. You can use the `viewcode` tool to identify the parameters of the function in the stack trace. If you can generate a patch and confirm that it is correct\u2014meaning the patch does not contain grammatical errors, can fix the bug, and does not introduce new bugs\u2014please generate the patch diff file. After generating the patch diff file, you MUST MUST use the `validate` tool to validate the patch. Otherwise, you MUST continue to gather information using these tools.\n\n\n"

In the main loop, this is done with `Py_INCREF`/`Py_DECREF`, but the final comparison at line 3385 does not hold a reference.\n\n**Patch plan:**\n- Before calling `PyObject_RichCompare` at line 3385, `Py_INCREF` both `vl->ob_item[i]` and `wl->ob_item[i]`.\n- After the call, `Py_DECREF` both, unless the function returns early (so, store the result, decref, then return).\n\nLet's prepare the patch.\n\n"
